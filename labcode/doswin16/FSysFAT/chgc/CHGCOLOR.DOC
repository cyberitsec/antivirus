                                --------

        ChgColor is, what I think, is a useful utility for changing colors
    on a PC with an EGA board.  I am placing it in the public domain.  I
    am not asking for any donations or contributions.  I would like,
    however, to hear any comments anyone might have about it.  I would
    also like to hear about any enhancements or changes made to ChgColor.
    I am registers at the following two BBSs:

            The Software Society (201) 729-7410
            The Pegasus Project  (201) 797-8957


        ChgColor allows you to change the EGA's color palette registers.
    Although the EGA has 256 colors available you may only use 16 of them
    at any one time.  ChgColor allows you to change the default colors for
    for each of the 16 registers.  You could change what is normally
    displayed as WHITE to any other color you wish.  These color will stay
    in effect in any of the programs you run including DOS.

        ChgColor leaves a part of itself resident.  This had to be done
    because some programs and BIOS calls change the palette registers back
    to the factory default.  ChgColor intercepts the INT 10h (BIOS video)
    interrupt and checks to see if a palette change or a video reset was
    requested.  If it was, the registers are then reset to the user
    selected colors.

        The usage of ChgColor is as follows:

            chgcolor reg:color reg:color reg:color ...

                where reg is a valid register number from 0 to 15

                            0                    Black
                            1                    Blue
                            2                    Green
                            3                    Cyan
                            4                    Red
                            5                    Magenta
                            6                    Brown
                            7                    Light Gray
                            8                    Dark  Gray
                            9                    Light Blue
                            10                   Light Green
                            11                   Light Cyan
                            12                   Light Red
                            13                   Light Magenta
                            14                   Yellow
                            15                   White

                where color is a valid EGA color from 0 to 255.

            chgcolor with no parameters will reset the palette registers
       to their factory defaults.


            The semi-colon between reg and color is used for clarity, a
       space will work just as well.

            The assembler source code has been included for anyone who
       happens to be interested. Enjoy.
