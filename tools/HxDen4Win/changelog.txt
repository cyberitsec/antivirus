======================

Below you find a list with the added features, changes and fixes for 
each version.


Version 1.5.2.0
---------------

  Unicode support)
- Update-search shows changes in the language of the running HxD version


Version 1.5.1.0 beta
--------------------

- Added Internet update checker
- Minor caret movement improvement
- Fix: Wrong caret position after deleting last byte of a row
- Fix: Formatting for modified data isn't loaded/saved correctly
- Fix: Exporting to Pascal, C, Java always uses empty file name

  toolbar) 


Version 1.5.0.0 beta
--------------------

- Modified data highlighted red and bold (configurable)
- Major internal optimizations regarding foldable section. This is especially 
  visible when opening large programs with the RAM-Editor and doing mouse 
  selections
- Optimized undo, which uses now far less memory by not saving original data
- New function "Open Disk-Image" (you can specify the sector-size)
- Reworked options dialog
- Optional creation of backup-files
- Offsets can now be displayed additionally as decimal or octal numbers
- More precise detection when progress dialog should show
- Selection-scrolling is more intuitive (also fixed a related bug)
- Mouse selection is smoother and more precise; a selection can begin inside a 
  hex pair
- Tooltip window beside the scrollbar showing the top sector when editing disks
  or disk images
- Page up and page down preserver the caret position
- Navigating to nibbles when clicking inside hex pairs
- Order of tabs can be changed through drag&drop
- Reworked scrollbar: hides when not needed, correctly handles resizing of 
  window
- Tab control draws its background according to the selected theme
- Tab and hex editor controls are visually united
- Minor visual adaptations
- Fix: After a "replace all"-operation the progress dialog sometimes keeps open
- Fix: Change order of Ctrl+Tab corresponds to the MDI order, not the order as
  seen in the tab control
- Fix: During a replace-operation the "resized file"-notification pops up 
  several times


Version 1.4.2.0
---------------

- New menu command "Refresh": updates the view and the caches
- Navigating to Nibbles (= half bytes) can now be done with CTRL+Left 
  respectively CTRL+Right

- FIX: Focus-problems of the progress window
- FIX: Rotated caption of the checksum-panel is under Win9x very small
- FIX: Flickering border when changing the window size and Windows-themes are 
       active. I fixed the corresponding bug in the VCL.
- FIX: If hex-editor window is very small an access violation appears
- FIX: Replace-dialog kann be shown, even when in readonly-mode, whichs stops 
       replace-operations anyway 
- FIX: Replacing with nothing raises an access violation
- FIX: RAM-Editor tries to show guarded pages
- FIX: Replace all: the progress window disappears often to reappear shortly 
       after again
- FIX: Confirmation dialog sometimes outside the screen
- FIX: New instance does not take over the multiinstance-settings
- many other corrections


Version 1.4.1.0 beta
--------------------

- FIX: Write error when inserting (due to overwriting of memory) 
- FIX: Ctrl+Shift+End raises an access violation 
- FIX: Wrong position of caret after insertion 
- FIX: A special order of insertion and deletion raises access violations 
- FIX: Starting HxD multiple times under Win9x raises an OS-exception 
       (managment error with DiskIO.dll) 
- smaller optimizations 
- correction of caret-movement in corner cases


Version 1.4.0.0 beta
--------------------

- HxD now support reading/writing onto logical or physical drives also under 
  Windows9x. All kinds and all sizes are supported (FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, 
  disk with int13 extensions and without). CDROM support will follow. 
- Notifications/Warnings can be deactivated (directly in the message window or 
  in the options) 
- Ask for user confirmation when deleting or inserting bytes 
- VB-Exporter removed: There is no reasonable way to define big arrays 
- Clearly less drive noise and no error message (happened on some NT 4.0 
  systems) when checking for a inserted disk 
- Modal dialog boxes flash when clicking outside the dialog box (as usual under
  Win98/Win2000+) 
- FIX: After "Saving as..." the whole filename is showed in the caption, but it
       should be without path 
- FIX: Deleting a selection with DEL does not update the statusbar 
- FIX: Deleting-function generates new foldable sections, but it should resize 
       the existing ones
- FIX: Delete with backspace was buggy 
- FIX: If caret is in a folded line, it doesn't move when scrolling horizontally 
- FIX: Changing between hex- and text-sections with TAB does not correctly 
       redraw the selection 
- other little things


Version 1.3.0.0 beta
--------------------

- New feature: Data-Folding  
- resizing of bookmark-symbol if text smaller than 16x16, else centering 
- FIX: Searching of integer numbers in big endian format was incorrect 
- FIX: Resizing of the window causes sometimes wrong caret repositioning 
- FIX: Although multiple instances are allowed, the first instance is always 
       activated 
- FIX: "Save as" and "Export" aborts without showing the save-dialog, when 
       default filename contains illegal characters 
- FIX: With some special fonts: After a restart of HxD another font is displayed
       than was selected the last time  
- FIX: Writing into readonly/unassigned memory regions causes drawing errors 
       (however data is left intact). 


Version 1.2.2.0
---------------

- Fix a minor caching issue


Version 1.2.1.0
---------------

- HxD is activated when a new instance starts and single instance option enabled
- Information displayed in the StatusBar is updated when MDIChild changes
- FIX: Trying to open a non-existant file using the commandline creates several
    access violations and error messages
- FIX: Displaying statistics of logical drives craches the program
   (caused by buggy caching-system)
- FIX: Progress-window sometimes creates floating point division by zero
- FIX: Opening pure Audio CD as logical drive generates access violations
- FIX: In a corner case caret position is not set correctly after undo
- FIX: Detection if a floppy disk is inserted is not always correct and causes
    the DriveOpen dialog to display wrong information
    (necessary checks make again empty floppy drives emit more noise)
    

Version 1.2.0.0
---------------

- Buffered reading making navigation more pleasant
- Sector separators and buttons as well as keyboard shortcuts added for 
  drive navigation
- On WinXP+ the whole drive is viewable/editable even if the driver reports 
  faked information
- Filename, StartOffset, EndOffset, Length and Date information was added to 
  source code exporters
- Minimzed floppy disk drive noise when checking if a floppy is inserted  
- New function: Select block (From-to-selection)
- Drawing of the offset col and row is synchronous with the drawing of the data
  section, even if source is slow (e.g. floppy disk)
- reduced PageControl flicker
- reduced flicker when maximizing windows
- Windows are opened maximized by default
- Single instance option
- Drives are opened write protected by default
- Pasting was extended to work with non-resizeable streams, such as drives:
  If there is enough place data overwrites old data instead of beeing inserted
- Theme can be changed in options (default or Tristan 2)
- Checksums/Digests can be copied to clipboard using the contextmenu or keyboard
  shortcuts    
- FIX: Entering a character in overwrite mode deleted the selection and then
  overwrote the following character, instead of just replacing the character
  at the caret
- FIX: Big streams (e.g. drives) didn't correctly work with scrollbars  
- more corrections


Version 1.1.0.0
---------------

- Searching supports new data types:
   - Integer numbers
   - Floating point numbers

  (not EXE-compression), to make it fit on a 1.4 MB diskette
  (for exmaple when you need HxD for recovery work)

- FIX: When Horizontal scrollbar jumped back, window content was not updated
- other minor tweaking
